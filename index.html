      City Voice displays the prevalence of citizen engagement throughout the
      city of Cambridge, MA. It uses publicly available information on written
      comments from individuals around the area to their city government in
      order to see where the most active and engaged residents tend to reside -
      and how this changes over the years.

      We can see that throughout the past five years, much of the public
      discourse has been dominated by the south and north-west regions of the
      city, where the bulk of long-term residents live, with large "holes" near
      MIT and Harvard, where many of the more transient student populations
      live.

      <br><br>

      As the years go on, however, and the East Cambridge/Kendall Square areas
      became more developed, a much larger presence from the newly populated
      tech hubs came into the picture - especially as the existing residents
      suddenly had much to say about construction noise, under or
      overdevelopment, and/or resulting resident displacement.

      <br><br>

      This display helps to visualize how public discourse can indicate
      both entrenched long-term trends in the demographic characteristics of
      active citizens around the city as well as how neighborhood development
      can spur evolutionary change in these trends.
